=POV Globe using arduino (atmega328P) and 72 SMD Leds=

==Overview=
Arduino based POV globe capable of displaying monocolour bitmaps upto 72 pixels high and x width. (uses 72 LEDs, and one input to get rotation speed)

Arduino byte array for images are generated using the c# program included in this project

Image displayed is synch'd to speed of motor using a reed switch, this allows image to display around hole globe correctly, and maintain a constant position. 

Code has been added to move the image slowly (so globe rotates nicely)

Some Images I have displayed on globe are shown below

Here's a picture of the globe showing the Hack a Day symbol.

At present I have the code rotating through 2 images showing each for a minute (this was done quickly and was a bit of a hack so needs doing properly still, I don't like the code)

== Circuit ==

Here is a schematic of the POV globe circuit, I tried to keep this as simple and with as few components for a few reasons, firstly I didn't want to spend anything making this (it is just a bit of fun), also I wanted to keep the weight of the rotating parts to a minimum. So for example you might notice the lack of resistors on the LED's, with my setup  this hasn't caused problems (yet), but I know I should have included them.
